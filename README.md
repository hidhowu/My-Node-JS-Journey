This is a complete documentation of my NODE JS Journey 
I have been using NODE JS for a while but didnt really learn the concepts so now i am learning it starting from the fundamentals to the advanced aspects 

During the learning process, I will be undertaking numerous coding challenges which and uniquely generated by AI based on real world usage
These challenges will test and help build my skills for real world applications

Each challenge has its own set of milestones i have to achieve to pass the challenge and also each challenge ranges in difficulty
* Easy
* Normal
* Hard
* Extreme

Some of the challenges also allow me to use AI assist which other disallow me from using AI assistance to really test my knowledge and practicality

For each section of the challenge i have to have completed a set of chapter in my course tutorial 

The Video Course used is 
A complete NODE JS Course by Procademy 


NOTE: For all challenges, All Static content (HTML, css) are generated by AI

Each phase of the challenge and course explores different aspects of node js seperated by sections defined by me

Since these challenges are AI generated, some of these challenges goes beyond the scope of this section and honestly seeing the challenges is already making me doubt my knowledge but well thats thee point of a challenge, right!

i am going to do it however and that way i can learn beyond what i have gained from the video lectures and become even better
